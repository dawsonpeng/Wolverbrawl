For Elimination, is there a time limit on each game? if the games are supposed to be a few minutes each, there should be a time based way to control win/loss

For protect the student, there should also probably be a timed end to the game.

How do you handle tiebreakers? If all brawlers are alive at the end of elimination or both students are protected for the whole game, how do you determine win/loss/draw?

What defines "disrupting" the student? Is it just damage based, or is there some sort of other metric for whether or not the student is protected?

Would there be skill based matchmaking based on trophies?

The progression system is a little unclear. Would progression be based on a user or a specific brawler? For example, if someone plays a certain brawler more, they level up that brawler and increase their stats (hp, damage, etc). If it is based on the user, what would progress look like? if resources are a separate system, and trophies are a separate system, what is the purpose of leveling?

Would brawler selection be limited? For example, could everyone select the same brawler, or would brawlers be limited to one per team?
